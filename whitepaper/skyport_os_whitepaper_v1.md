## 1. Introduction

SKYPORT OS & AVIATOR-X is an open, sovereign protocol for future aerial cities. Designed to integrate ethical AI, low-altitude mobility (eVTOL), regenerative energy, and decentralized governance, it aims to create a new civic layer for the 21st century â€” above the land, beyond borders.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Decentralized by Design**: Built without reliance on any single nation, company, or ideology.  
- **Ethical AI Alignment**: All AI systems must be transparent, auditable, and benefit the collective.  
- **Civic Autonomy**: Every citizen holds digital identity and governance rights via open protocols.  
- **Post-Military Urbanism**: No military usage, surveillance capitalism, or extractive control allowed.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### SKYPORT OS Layers:
- **Mobility Layer**: eVTOL routing, vertiport coordination, aerial zoning  
- **Energy Layer**: Regenerative solarâ€“wind grids, mesh energy markets  
- **Governance Layer**: Tokenized proposals, citizen AI agents, open ballots  
- **AI Layer**: Modular, ethical LLMs for urban optimization and transparency

## 4. Collaboration Framework

We invite:  
- AI Labs (open/hybrid models)  
- Urban AI Researchers & Simulators  
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)  
- Builders of open AI governance tools

Partners will gain:  
- Early contributor status & attribution  
- Shared IP & co-ownership of tools  
- Access to aerial sandbox zones  
- Public recognition in historical documentation
