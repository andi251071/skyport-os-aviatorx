## 1. Introduction

SKYPORT OS & AVIATOR-X is an open, sovereign protocol for future aerial cities. Designed to integrate ethical AI, low-altitude mobility (eVTOL), regenerative energy, and decentralized governance, it aims to create a new civic layer for the 21st century — above the land, beyond borders.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Decentralized by Design**: Built without reliance on any single nation, company, or ideology.
- **Ethical AI Alignment**: All AI systems must be transparent, auditable, and benefit the collective.
- **Civic Autonomy**: Every citizen holds digital identity and governance rights via open protocols.
- **Post-Military Urbanism**: No military usage, surveillance capitalism, or extractive control allowed.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### SKYPORT OS Layers:
- **Mobility Layer**: eVTOL routing, vertiport coordination, aerial zoning
- **Energy Layer**: Regenerative solar–wind grids, mesh energy markets
- **Governance Layer**: Tokenized proposals, citizen AI agents, open ballots
- **AI Layer**: Modular, ethical LLMs for urban optimization and transparency
